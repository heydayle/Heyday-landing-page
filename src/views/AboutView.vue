        When everything in me seemed to have been extinguished like a fire with nothing left to burn where the rain fell in October. Suddenly, I found myself a happiness, everything was suddenly repainted. Once again, feelings that had cooled down began to warm and strangely blush. The rain has not stopped, the wind is still whistling in my ears and the fire has gone out but I feel a strange warmth just landed here, giving me so much strength, so much faith, is a miracle I'm out of the place where there's only black and white. It's a flower, when it comes it repaints the monochrome memories to become magical and full of life, drawing faith and helping emotions to live again and my soul is safe. . That pretty flower has walked by my side, helped me through emotional roads, brought me to the high notes of joy and happiness, fought with me with the bass of sadness and fear. , deciphering the choices on the roads passed. Not only a pretty flower, but also an emotional flower, very emotional, always listening and understanding, always thinking of others, sometimes irritable, sometimes scared but never denying any misfortune, sometimes wandering, sometimes difficult to please and believe in the definition of asking for a cause and reaping rewards, always reminding I have to stay awake to keep this life line. Me and that flower are a special feeling, for me the love for that flower is not enough when the emotion has surpassed the limit of love, when everything was over the limit, everything started to get worse, I felt that I couldn't touch that flower anymore, no more everyday stories like before, no more, no moreâ€¦ But that flower once said, what changes us today will be the turning point for the future what i'm about to move forward, then i'll just see that flower just like any other normal thing, so try. From the colors that the flower brings will be the way to guide me to where I need to go.
